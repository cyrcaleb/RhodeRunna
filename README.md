I also now have a much greater appreciation for Unity as I see how many things in the background it manages so that we as programmers do not have to worry about them. 

###Fun/Interesting Parts(To me atleast):
The whole grid generation I find super interesting as the grid is made up of a 2D ArrayList of type Road. The road class
